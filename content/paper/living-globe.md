# Abstract

In this paper we showcase Living Globe, a web application for tri-dimensional
worldwide demographical data visualization. It allows the simultaneous
representation of multiple indicators, like total population, density,
population-growth, life expectancy, net migration, crude birth rate, crude
death rate and the ratio between the last two. The mapping of data to the
provided visual structures is configurable by the user, introducing an aspect
of customization which encourages a more immediate, visual-only interpretation
of the data. Additionally, the represented data is normalized within an
adjustable scale. This can be used to filter out extremely high or extremely
low samples, uniforming the remaining data and improving its visibility.

The usability of this tool was tested by agnostic individuals, and the results
indicate that the data filtering and customizable mapping features encourage a
faster interpretation of relational information. Moreover, this tool improves
on previous state-of-the-art work by implementing interaction capabilities like
selection, search and filtering.
