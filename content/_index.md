## Experience

Over four years of hands-on experience with Backend Architecture, Distributed
Systems, Stream Processing, Mobile & Web Frontend Development, UI/UX Design and
Information Retrieval. Worked extensively with languages like Java, Kotlin,
Javascript ES6, Typescript, Swift and Objective-C, and technologies like REST,
gRPC, WebSocket, MQTT, React, Android and iOS.

Recently finished my internship at [Bosch
Thermotechnology](https://www.bosch.pt/en/our-company/bosch-in-portugal/),
where I developed a scalable backend and web frontend platform for time-series
analysis and annotation, employing distributed system techniques and best
practices in order to handle massive amounts of data with high cardinality.

Previously worked at [Ubiwhere](http://www.ubiwhere.com/en/) as a backend
developer on a business process modeling and integration platform, and as a
mobile developer in various Android and iOS applications for brands like
[Vodafone Smart Parking](https://parking.vodafone.citibrain.com/),
[Bewegen](https://www.bewegen.pt/about/app/),
[Bikeemotion](http://www.bikeemotion.com/), [Anacom](http://www.netmede.pt/app)
and [Prio](https://app.prioenergy.com/).

I have co-founded two tech startups, [Thumbeo](http://www.thumbeo.com/en/) and
YouClap, where I had the chance to act both as a creative director and a
technical lead, guiding co-workers in the development and marketing of mobile
apps, overseeing the interactive design of the final product, and devising
unique interface ideas in the consumer space.

I also have a strong background in academia: earned a Master's in Software
Engineering (thesis awaiting review) and a Bachelor in Information Technology
(thesis graded 19 out of 20); worked with a [Bioinformatics research
group](http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/); [published three papers](/papers/) in
various fields such as Information Security and Information Visualization; and
spoken at various conferences around the globe.


## Ethos

While only having a few years of professional experience, I've managed to gain
experience in multiple areas ranging all ends of the development stack. I firmly
believe that having a wide breadth of understanding is vital to gain perspective
in how to approach specific challenges and to grow as an engineer.

More than simply focusing on coding, I have always pushed myself to complete my
tasks with a high standard of quality and polish, researching best practices and
bleeding edge methods. I am enthusiastic about re-thinking and over-thinking
systems to achieve optimized solutions.


## Work with me

I am currently looking for a job that joins the technical aspect of software
engineering (e.g. distributed systems, API design, data handling) with more
creative elements (e.g. UI, interaction design, shaders). Feel free to [send me
an email](mailto:hi@edduarte.com).
