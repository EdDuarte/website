## Experience

Recently finished my internship at Ubiwhere, where I worked as a backend
developer (business process modeling and integration platform) and a mobile
developer (Android and iOS applications for various brands brands like
Vodafone, Anacom and Prio).

I have co-founded two tech startups where I had the chance to act both as a
creative director and a lead developer, guiding co-workers in the development
and advertising of mobile apps, overseeing the interactive design of the final
product and devising unique interactive and interface ideas in the consumer
space.

I also have a strong background in academia: earned a Bachelor in Information
Technology (currently finishing up my Master's in Software Engineering); worked
with a bioinformatics research team; published three papers in fields such as
Information Security and Information Visualization; and spoken at various
conferences around the globe.

## Ethos

More than simply focusing on coding, I have always pushed myself to research
best practices and bleeding edge methods in order to complete my tasks with a
high standard of quality and polish. I am enthusiastic about re-thinking and
over-thinking systems, and achieving unique and optimized solutions.

Throughout the few years of professional experience that I've had, I have
actively looked for a wide variety of projects so as to improve my versatility.
I have done research and implementation of scalable software ranging all ends
of the development stack: from web & mobile frontend coding, to UI/UX design
and prototyping, to middleware implementation (fully baked platforms or
brokers) to RESTful services deployment.

## Work with me

I am not currently looking for a job, as I am working on my Master's thesis at
the University of Aveiro, but feel free to [send me an
email](mailto:hi@edduarte.com) or find me elsewhere on the web with the
username 'edduarte'.
