## Experience

Over three years of hands-on experience with Backend Architecture, Mobile
Development, UI/UX Design and Information Retrieval. Worked on multiple
projects that extensively used languages like Java, Kotlin, Objective-C, Swift
and Javascript ES6, and technologies / frameworks like Spring, Jetty, Tomcat,
Socket.io, Websocket, MQTT, Redis, Hazelcast, Cassandra, MongoDB, Android and
iOS, among others.

Recently finished my internship at [Ubiwhere](http://www.ubiwhere.com/en/),
where I worked as a backend developer (business process modeling and
integration platform for [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en)) and a
mobile developer (Android and iOS applications for various brands like
Vodafone, [Prio](https://app.prioenergy.com/), [Anacom
Netmede](http://www.netmede.pt/app), [Bikeemotion](http://www.bikeemotion.com/)
and [Citibrain](http://www.citibrain.com/en/)).

I have co-founded two tech startups ([Thumbeo](http://www.thumbeo.com/en/) and
YouClap) where I had the chance to act both as a creative director and a
technical lead, guiding co-workers in the development and marketing of mobile
apps, overseeing the interactive design of the final product, and devising
unique ideas in the consumer space.

I also have a strong background in academia: currently working on my Master's
in Software Engineering; earned a Bachelor in Information Technology (with a
thesis graded 19 out of 20); worked with a bioinformatics research team;
published three papers in various fields, such as Information Security and
Information Visualization; and spoken at various conferences around the globe.

## Ethos

More than simply focusing on coding, I have always pushed myself to complete my
tasks with a high standard of quality and polish, researching best practices
and bleeding edge methods. I am enthusiastic about re-thinking and
over-thinking systems to achieve optimized solutions.

Throughout the few years of professional experience that I've had, I have done
research and implementation of scalable software ranging all ends of the
development stack, from web & mobile frontend coding, to UI/UX design and
prototyping, to middleware implementation (fully-fledged platforms or brokers)
to RESTful services deployment.

## Work with me

I am not currently looking for a job, as I am working on my Master's thesis at
the University of Aveiro, but feel free to [send me an
