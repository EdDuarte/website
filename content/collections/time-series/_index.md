Between 2018 and 2020 I conducted a series of studies and benchmarks on time series analysis
technologies for both storage and visualization. Along with these studies I
developed a time series analysis and annotation (i.e. knowledge-sharing) system for Bosch
Thermotechnology, focusing on scalability and resilience to high concurrent traffic. The resulting
studies and implemented techniques were then described in my Master's Thesis and in two follow-up
research papers, listed below.
