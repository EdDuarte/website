Between 2018 and 2020 I conducted a series of studies and benchmarks on time series analysis
technologies (including both storage and visualization systems) and their level of efficiency when
handling common analysis tasks and intensive workloads. Along with these studies, I developed a time
series analysis and annotation (i.e. knowledge-sharing) system for Bosch Thermotechnology, focusing
on scalability and resilience to high concurrent traffic. The resulting studies and implemented
techniques were then described in my Master's Thesis and in two follow-up research papers, listed
below.
