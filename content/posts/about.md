Hi! I'm Ed Duarte, a Full-Stack Software Engineer from Portugal currently living in Zürich,
Switzerland. I am highly experienced in Backend Architecture, API Development, Distributed Systems
and Continuous Integration / Deployment. I also have some experience in Web & Mobile
Frontend Development.

## Experience

Currently working at [SwissSign](https://www.swisssign.com/) as a backend engineer and tech lead on
a OIDC authentication platform with qualified identity-checking and electronic signing
(ZertEs-compliant), serving as the primary authentication and doc-sign system for various
third-parties in Switzerland (e.g. Swiss Post).

Previously worked at [Bosch
Thermotechnology](https://www.bosch.pt/en/our-company/bosch-in-portugal/),
where I developed a [scalable platform for time series analysis and
annotation](/distributed-and-scalable-platform-for-collaborative-analysis-of-massive-time-series-data-sets/),
creating a ReactJS application and designing a distributed architecture with
polyglot persistence that handles high amounts of traffic and massive
multivariate series data sets.

Before that I worked at [Ubiwhere](http://www.ubiwhere.com/en/) as a backend
developer on a business process modeling and integration platform, and as a
mobile developer in various Android and iOS applications for brands like
[Citibrain](http://www.citibrain.com/en/solutions/smart-parking/) (in
particular the Smart Parking app, which is used by Vodafone Portugal),
[Bewegen](https://www.bewegen.pt/about/app/),
[Bikeemotion](http://www.bikeemotion.com/), [Anacom](http://www.netmede.pt/app)
and [Prio](https://www.prio.pt/pt/app_237.html).

I have co-founded two tech startups where I had the chance to act both as a
creative director and a technical lead, guiding co-workers in the development
and marketing of mobile apps, overseeing the interactive design of the final
product, and devising unique interface ideas in the consumer space.

I also have a strong background in academia: earned a Master's degree in Software Engineering and a
Bachelor's in Information Technology; worked with [bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/) and
[marine life](http://www.cesam.ua.pt/?menu=3429&language=eng&tabela=post) research groups; and
[published papers](/publications/) in various fields, including Data Analysis, Information
Visualization and Information Security. I have also published five papers on these fields, and
spoken at various conferences around the globe.


## Ethos

Throughout my entire career, I have been very
lucky to work in ambitious projects with fantastic
people, assimilating experience from various domains ranging all aspects of the
product development life cycle.

I am enthusiastic about re-thinking and
over-thinking systems to achieve optimized solutions.
I firmly believe that having a wide breadth of understanding is vital to gain
perspective when approaching specific challenges and to grow as an engineer.
More than simply focusing on coding, I have always pushed myself to complete my
tasks with a high standard of quality and polish, applying best practices and
researching bleeding edge methods.
