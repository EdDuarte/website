Hi! I'm Ed Duarte, a Full-Stack Software Engineer from Portugal with over five
years of hands-on experience in Backend Architecture, Distributed Systems, Web &
Mobile Frontend Development and UI/UX Design. I've worked extensively with
languages such as Java, Kotlin, Typescript, Javascript ES6 and Swift.

## Experience

Recently worked at [Bosch
Thermotechnology](https://www.bosch.pt/en/our-company/bosch-in-portugal/),
where I developed a [scalable platform for time series analysis and
annotation](/distributed-and-scalable-platform-for-collaborative-analysis-of-massive-time-series-data-sets/),
designing a ReactJS application and deploying a distributed architecture with
polyglot persistence that handles high amounts of traffic and massive
multivariate series data sets.

Previously worked at [Ubiwhere](http://www.ubiwhere.com/en/) as a backend
developer on a business process modeling and integration platform, and as a
mobile developer in various Android and iOS applications for brands like
[Citibrain](http://www.citibrain.com/en/solutions/smart-parking/) (in
particular the Smart Parking app, which is used by Vodafone Portugal),
[Bewegen](https://www.bewegen.pt/about/app/),
[Bikeemotion](http://www.bikeemotion.com/), [Anacom](http://www.netmede.pt/app)
and [Prio](https://www.prio.pt/pt/app_237.html).

I have co-founded two tech startups where I had the chance to act both as a
creative director and a technical lead, guiding co-workers in the development
and marketing of mobile apps, overseeing the interactive design of the final
product, and devising unique interface ideas in the consumer space.

I also have a strong background in academia: earned a Master's degree in
Software Engineering and a Bachelor's in Information Technology; worked with
[bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/) and [marine
life](http://www.oceano21.org/info.asp?id=46&idpai=3&LN=EN) research groups; and
[published papers](/papers/) in various fields, including Data Analysis,
Information Visualization and Information Security.


## Ethos

Throughout the few years of academic and professional career I have had, I was
lucky to have the opportunity of working in ambitious projects with fantastic
colleagues and leading teams of talented developers and designers, assimilating
experience from various domains ranging all aspects of the product development
life cycle.

I firmly believe that having a wide breadth of understanding is vital to gain
perspective when approaching specific challenges and to grow as an engineer.
More than simply focusing on coding, I have always pushed myself to complete my
tasks with a high standard of quality and polish, applying best practices and
researching bleeding edge methods. I am enthusiastic about re-thinking and
over-thinking systems to achieve optimized solutions.


## Work with me

I am currently looking for a job that merges the technical aspects of Software
Engineering (e.g. Distributed Systems, Data Management, Frontend Development)
with more creative domains (e.g. Interaction Design, Computer Graphics,
Information Visualization).
