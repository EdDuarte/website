The [Mobile Computing Contest](http://concursocomputacaomovel.com/), organised
by IEEE and the University of Aveiro Union of Students (AETTUA), was an event
where competing groups of students had to design and develop mobile
applications. I was appointed team leader of a group, and co-developed an
Android application with colleagues João Pedrosa and Pedro Fernandes. The design
was done by design students Tiago Marabuto and Ricardo Silva. The resulting
application, called *Travis*, allowed users to look for taxis in the near
vicinity and schedule rides with them (similarly to Uber), as well as perform
secure payment transactions using NFC.

After receiving a lot of positive feedback from the juri, our team was awarded
the 1st Prize: an incubation period with [Ubiwhere](https://www.ubiwhere.com/)
to develop the application further and to enter the market as a startup.

Under this incubation period, Travis became
[Thumbeo](http://www.thumbeo.com/en/), changing its scope from taxis to rides
that could be posted by anyone.
