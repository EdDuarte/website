The recent expansion of metrification on a daily basis has led to the production
of massive quantities of data, and in many cases, these collected metrics are
only useful for knowledge building when seen as a full sequence of data ordered
by time, which constitutes a time series. To find and interpret meaningful
behavioral patterns in time series, a multitude of analysis software tools have
been developed. Many of the existing solutions use annotations to enable the
curation of a knowledge base that is shared between a group of researchers over
a network. However, these tools also lack appropriate mechanisms to handle a
high number of concurrent requests and to properly store massive data sets and
ontologies, as well as suitable representations for annotated data that are
visually interpretable by humans and explorable by automated systems.

The goal of the work presented in this dissertation is to iterate on existing
time series analysis software and build a platform for the collaborative
analysis of massive time series data sets, leveraging state-of-the-art
technologies for querying, storing and displaying time series and annotations. A
theoretical and domain-agnostic model was proposed to enable the implementation
of a distributed, extensible, secure and high-performant architecture that
handles various annotation proposals in simultaneous and avoids any data loss
from overlapping contributions or unsanctioned changes. Analysts can share
annotation projects with peers, restricting a set of collaborators to a smaller
scope of analysis and to a limited catalog of annotation semantics.

Annotations can express meaning not only over a segment of time, but also over a
subset of the series that coexist in the same segment. A novel visual encoding
for annotations is proposed, where annotations are rendered as arcs traced only
over the affected series' curves in order to reduce visual clutter.

Moreover, the implementation of a full-stack prototype with a reactive web
interface was described, directly following the proposed architectural and
visualization model while applied to the HVAC domain. The performance of the
prototype under different architectural approaches was benchmarked, and the
interface was tested in its usability. Overall, the work described in this
dissertation contributes with a more versatile, intuitive and scalable time
series annotation platform that streamlines the knowledge-discovery workflow.

## Dissertation outline

1. **Introduction** overviews the various concepts surrounding time series
analysis, time series visualization techniques, digital annotations (and how
these have been used in time series analysis), and distributed systems;

2. **State of the art** presents an in-depth overview of state of the art
methodologies and technologies currently applied to analysis, storage and
visualization of time series and annotations;

3. **Proposed Model** proposes a blueprint for the development of a time series
analysis and annotation platform at the theoretical level, describing an ideal
architecture and visualization tool for handling both time series and ontology
data;

4. **Implementation** iterates on the blueprint proposed in Chapter 3 by
implementing and describing a working prototype for a collaborative time series
analysis architecture and web application, listing the specific tools that were
employed for it and the techniques that allowed further optimized usage of state
of the art technologies to handle the mentioned requirements;

5. **Evaluation** takes the implemented platform and benchmarks its features, in
order to evaluate how its architecture handles realistic scenarios and how it
compares with other potential architectures, as well as how its interface
adheres to interaction design standards;

6. **Conclusion and future work** gives an account of the observed behaviors and
caveats in the prototype during development and evaluation phases, relates the
ways in which the proposed model for time series annotation improves on existing
tools, and leaves a few clues to how the proposed platform can be iterated on in
order to extend its capabilities and improve its overall performance and
quality.
