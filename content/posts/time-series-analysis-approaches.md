In order to adapt to the recent phenomenon of exponential growth of time series data sets in both
academic and commercial environments, and with the goal of deriving valuable knowledge from this
data, a multitude of analysis software tools have been developed to allow groups of collaborating
researchers to find and annotate meaningful behavioral patterns. However, these tools commonly lack
appropriate mechanisms to handle massive time series data sets of high cardinality, as well as
suitable visual encodings for annotated data.

In this paper we conduct a comparative study of architectural, persistence and visualization methods
that can enable these analysis tools to scale with a continuously-growing data set and handle
intense workloads of concurrent traffic. We implement these approaches within a web platform,
integrated with authentication, versioning, and locking mechanisms that prevent overlapping
contributions or unsanctioned changes. Additionally, we measure the performance of a set of
databases when writing and reading varying amounts of series data points, as well as the performance
of different architectural models at scale.
